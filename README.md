# Microbiome Data Science for One Health Applications

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, reproducible microbiome data science workflow
using Python, focusing on One Health, environmental, agricultural, and host-associated microbiomes.

A biologically realistic **synthetic microbiome dataset** was generated to ensure full
reproducibility while preserving ecological and statistical properties observed in real datasets.

## Key Analyses
- Alpha & beta diversity analysis
- Taxonomic composition profiling
- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene simulation
- Machine learning-based environment prediction
- Microbial co-occurrence and AMR linkage network analysis

## Technologies
- Python, pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy, seaborn, matplotlib
- networkx

## Applications
- One Health surveillance
- Environmental microbiology
- Agricultural microbiomes
- AMR risk assessment

## Disclaimer
All datasets are synthetic but parameterized using distributions commonly observed in published microbiome studies. This repository is intended for methodological demonstration.
